# NodeLoad.js
script that creates a loading like animation

use clearInterval(loading) to stop the script im afraid that console.clear() doesnt cut it

small issues like the console lagging can happen

how to execute for complete skids 

3 dots top right corner, more tools, developer tools all the way at the bottom, if you are not already in it go to the top and press console, now copy to clipboard and paste into the box
